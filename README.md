**Data Description**

The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- Date
- Average Price
- Region
- Type
- Season

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The project performs an exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between variables.

**Regression Models**

The project compares the performance of the following regression models:
- Linear Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Elastic Net Regression
- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- Support Vector Regression

**Model Comparison**

The project evaluates the performance of each regression model using the following metrics:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Coefficient of Determination (R-squared)
- Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE)

**Results**

The project presents the results of the model comparison, including:
- A summary of the performance metrics for each model
- Visualizations of the predicted vs. actual values for each model
- A discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of each model
